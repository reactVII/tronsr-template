## Intro

RedMars Node_init provides a way for Super Representatives to publish their information right where the voters are, on Tronscan!

React7.Store can use this template to build a static page which will be shown on RedMars Node_init Modules. The link will be placed in the voting overview page right next to the name.

By editing files in the repository on Github the Super Representative can manage their own content.


## Example

The example shows which files are presented where. Whenever the files on Github are modified the page will instantly be updated

__Example Super Representative Pages__

## How to use

__This guide assumes that you already have an account which has React7.Store (candidate) status__

## Step 2: Fill in the template

The template can now be modified by editing files on Github.

* Click the file you want to edit

Files are written in markdown format. An excellent intro can be found at https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

* Update the logo.png and banner.png  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tronscan/docs/master/images/github-upload-files.png)  
Then click on "choose your files" and make sure the logo or banner you want to upload is named `logo.png` or `banner.png` to overwrite the placeholder images.

After you filled in the template it can now be published on https://tronscan.org

## Step 3: Publish to Tronscan

* Navigate to http://redmars75.react7.store/

## FAQ

* __I've modified a file but the changes aren't visible on redmars75.react.store?__  
  Contents from the repository are served using the Github CDN which uses aggressive caching. It may take a few minutes before the changes are reflected on redmars75.react.store.
* __Why are HTML elements visible on Github but not on redmars75.react.store?__  
  redmars75.react.store will sanitize all HTML tags for security reasons, only standard markdown tags are allowed
